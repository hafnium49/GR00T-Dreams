# GR00T Dreams Workflow - Dataset Synthesis for SO-101
# Target: Synthesize augmented dataset trainable by GR00T N1.5 for SO-101 robotic arm

## Objective: Generate Synthetic Training Data for SO-101 Paper Return Task
# We have: Hafnium49/paper_return_front_view dataset (SO-100 compatible)
# We want: Augmented dataset with synthetic variations for SO-101 training

## Recommended Workflow: Cosmos Fine-tuning + Dream Generation + IDM Action Extraction

### Step 1: Fine-tune Cosmos Video World Model on Real Data
# Post-train Cosmos Predict-2 on your filtered paper_return dataset
# This teaches the world model your specific paper manipulation patterns
# Input: Real demo videos + text prompts ("Move paper into red square")
# Output: Fine-tuned Cosmos model that understands your task

### Step 2: Generate Synthetic Dream Videos  
# Use fine-tuned Cosmos model to generate variations
# Input: Seed frames + varied prompts (lighting, backgrounds, poses)
# Output: Hundreds of synthetic robot videos showing paper manipulation

### Step 3: Extract Actions from Dreams using IDM
# Use SO-100 IDM model (or train custom SO-101 IDM) to extract actions
# Input: Synthetic videos from Step 2
# Output: LeRobot-compatible episodes with state/action trajectories

### Step 4: Create Augmented Dataset
# Merge real Hafnium49/paper_return_front_view with synthetic episodes
# Input: Original dataset + synthetic IDM episodes
# Output: Augmented training corpus ready for GR00T N1.5 fine-tuning

## Alternative: Use Pre-trained Cosmos (Faster but Less Customized)
# Skip Step 1, use pre-trained Cosmos models directly
# May need more post-processing to match your specific setup

## ðŸŽ¯ For Your Use Case (SO-101 + paper_return synthesis):
# Recommendation: Use fine-tuned Cosmos approach for better task-specific generation
# Result: Rich synthetic dataset for training robust SO-101 policies
